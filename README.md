# Power-BI Projects
This is a collection of my Power BI projects together with the datasets used.
Below are the updated list of Power BI projects completed;
## 1. Minnesota Interstate Traffic Volume.
This is a Minnesota Interstate Highways Traffic Volume analysis. The cleaned and transformed excel data was loaded into Power BI and analysed with distinct charts based on the traffic volume’s relation with Weather, Holiday & Year.
Cloudy and Clear conditions collectively contributed massively to the Traffic Volume per Weather conditions with the former being the major contributor. Rain has a fairly large amount of total traffic volume.
The Sum of Traffic Volume in the year 2017 was the greatest, with 2012 being the year with the least traffic volume in the interstate.
Per holidays, New Year’s Day had the most traffic volume but holidays had no significant impact on the traffic volume.
Recommendations: Reduction of driving or riding in precipitation & low-visibility weather conditions, should be monitored & prevented. 
Further analysis should be done later with the hourly, daily and monthly traffic volume relations in consideration.
