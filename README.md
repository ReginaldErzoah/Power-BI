# Power-BI Projects
This is a collection of my Power BI projects together with the datasets used.
Below are the updated list of Power BI projects completed;
## 1. Minnesota Interstate Traffic Volume
This is a Minnesota Interstate Highways Traffic Volume analysis. The cleaned and transformed excel data was loaded into Power BI and analysed with distinct charts based on the traffic volume’s relation with Weather, Holiday & Year.
Cloudy and Clear conditions collectively contributed massively to the Traffic Volume per Weather conditions with the former being the major contributor. Rain has a fairly large amount of total traffic volume.
The Sum of Traffic Volume in the year 2017 was the greatest, with 2012 being the year with the least traffic volume in the interstate.
Per holidays, New Year’s Day had the most traffic volume but holidays had no significant impact on the traffic volume.
Recommendations: Reduction of driving or riding in precipitation & low-visibility weather conditions, should be monitored & prevented. 
Further analysis should be done later with the hourly, daily and monthly traffic volume relations in consideration. 

# 2. Bank Target Marketing Visualization
Per insights from visualization, majority of Clients fall in the Management & Blue-Collar jobs. The job distribution suggests a diverse clientele. The majority of clients fall into the middle-aged category (37,823).
Married clients have the highest average balance ($1,458.85), and this indicates that marital status of clients may have an influence on their financial standing.
Out of all clients, 10,578 (18.76%) have made a deposit while 45,795 (81.24%) have not. The data suggests a substantial portion of clients have not made a deposit, potentially indicating an opportunity for targeted marketing or incentive campaigns to encourage deposits.
Further analysis and segmentation could unveil deeper patterns and opportunities for the bank to enhance its services and customer satisfaction.

# 3. Sales Analytics Project
